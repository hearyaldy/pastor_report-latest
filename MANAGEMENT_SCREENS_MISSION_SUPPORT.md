## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Mission Selector UI Pattern
All management screens now use consistent mission selector styling:

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Colors.blue.shade50,
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
    border: Border.all(color: Colors.blue.shade200),
  ),
  child: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
    child: Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        Row(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.admin_panel_settings, color: Colors.blue.shade700, size: 20),
            Text('Super Admin: Select Mission'),
          ],
        ),
        DropdownButtonFormField<String>(...),
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
```

### State Management Pattern
```dart
class _ScreenState extends State<Screen> {
  String? _selectedMissionId;
  List<Mission> _missions = [];
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadMissions();
  }
  
  Future<void> _loadMissions() async {
    final user = Provider.of<AuthProvider>(context, listen: false).user;
    
    if (user?.userRole == UserRole.superAdmin) {
      _missions = await MissionService.instance.getAllMissions();
      if (_missions.isNotEmpty && _selectedMissionId == null) {
        _selectedMissionId = _missions.first.id;
      }
    } else if (user?.mission != null) {
      _selectedMissionId = user!.mission;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔒 **Security & Permissions**

### Data Isolation
- **SuperAdmin**: Can access all missions via selector
- **Admin**: Can access all missions via selector  
- **Mission Admin**: Restricted to their assigned mission only
- **Editor**: Restricted to their assigned mission only (department management only)
- **Regular Users**: No access to management screens

### Permission Enforcement
- Backend Firestore rules enforce mission-based access
- Frontend UI properly filters data based on user role and mission
- Mission selector only available to SuperAdmin and Admin roles

## 📱 **User Experience Improvements**

### Visual Consistency
- All mission selectors use consistent blue-themed styling
- Clear visual hierarchy with admin panel indicators
- Proper loading states and error handling

### Navigation Flow
1. SuperAdmin logs in
2. Accesses any management screen
3. Sees mission selector at top of screen
4. Selects mission from dropdown
5. Screen automatically filters to show only that mission's data
6. Can switch missions without leaving the screen

### Performance
- Mission data loaded once on screen initialization
- Efficient filtering using mission-specific service calls
- Proper state management prevents unnecessary rebuilds

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**
