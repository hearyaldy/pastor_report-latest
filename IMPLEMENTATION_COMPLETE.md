2. **Remove Seed Button**: After successfully seeding, you can optionally remove or comment out the seed button in `admin_dashboard.dart` (lines 50-106).

3. **Admin Access**: Make sure you have at least one admin account before testing user management features.

4. **Department Icons**: The available icons are predefined in `Department.availableIcons`. You can add more by editing `lib/models/department_model.dart`.

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Remove Seed Button**: After first run, consider removing the seed button from admin dashboard
2. **Add More Icons**: Extend the available icons list in the Department model
3. **Add User Search**: Implement search functionality in user management
4. **Add Department Ordering**: Allow reordering departments by priority
5. **Add Analytics**: Track form submissions and user activity
