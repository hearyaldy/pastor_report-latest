# Mission-Based Structure Implementation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of implementing the mission-based structure in your Pastor Report application. The mission-based structure provides a hierarchical relationship between missions and departments, making it easier to organize and filter data.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the implementation, make sure you have:
- Completed the models (Mission and Department)
- Created the services (MissionService and DepartmentService)
- Set up the MissionProvider

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enabling the Mission-Based Structure

To enable the mission-based structure:

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to Settings > Admin Utilities
3. In the "Data Structure Management" section, toggle the "Use Mission-Based Structure" switch to ON
4. A confirmation message will appear indicating the structure has been changed

### 2. Migrating Existing Data

If you have existing department data in the legacy structure, you need to migrate it:

1. In the Admin Utilities screen, click the "Migrate to Mission Structure" button
2. Confirm the migration when prompted
3. Wait for the process to complete
4. A success message will appear when migration is finished

### 3. Managing Missions and Departments

After enabling the mission-based structure:

1. Click on "Open Mission Management" in the Admin Utilities screen
2. Use the tabbed interface to switch between Missions and Departments
3. Add, edit, or delete missions and their associated departments
4. Changes will be reflected immediately in the dashboard

### 4. Reseeding Data (If Needed)

If you want to reset all data with default missions and departments:

1. In the Admin Utilities screen, click "Reseed All Data"
2. Confirm the reseed operation when prompted
3. The system will create default missions and departments

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation involved:

1. **Dashboard Screen Updates**:
   - Modified to use MissionProvider instead of direct DepartmentService calls
   - Added mission filtering based on user's assigned mission
   - Updated department filtering to work with the mission structure

2. **Provider Integration**:
   - Added MissionProvider initialization
   - Updated department loading to use mission-based filtering
   - Connected UI components to the provider for state management

3. **Navigation Updates**:
   - Updated the department navigation to work with mission-based departments
   - Ensured proper filtering in the InAppWebViewScreen

4. **Admin Tools**:
   - Created mission management interfaces
   - Added migration utilities
   - Implemented data structure toggle functionality

## Benefits

The mission-based structure provides:

1. Improved organization of departments by mission
2. Better filtering and access control
3. Clearer hierarchical relationships
4. More efficient database queries
5. Better scalability for future enhancements

## Troubleshooting

If departments aren't appearing in the dashboard:
1. Verify the user is assigned to a mission
2. Check that departments exist for that mission
3. Ensure the mission-based structure is enabled
4. Try reseeding the data if necessary

If you encounter errors during migration:
1. Check Firebase permissions
2. Verify database structure
3. Look for department records with missing mission fields
