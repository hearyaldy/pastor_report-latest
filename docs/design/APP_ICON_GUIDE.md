# App Icon Design Guide for PastorPro

This document provides guidance for creating a minimal, professional app icon for PastorPro.

## Core Concept
Create a clean, minimal icon that represents the pastoral ministry management focus of the PastorPro app. The design should be modern yet approachable, with a professional appearance suitable for church leadership.

## Design Elements

### Primary Symbol Options
Choose one of these central elements:
- A simplified, geometric church steeple or spire
- An open book (representing both the Bible and record-keeping)
- A stylized shepherd's staff with a subtle cross element
- Overlapping circles representing community/connection

### Color Palette
- **Primary Color**: Use the app's existing primary blue (#1A4870)
- **Secondary Accent**: Consider a warm complement like a soft orange (#F9DBBA) as seen in the app's card backgrounds
- **Background**: Either white for clean contrast or a very light blue gradient

### Style Guidelines
- Use geometric shapes with minimal detail
- Employ flat design principles (no heavy gradients or shadows)
- Maintain clear silhouettes that are recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure 1:1 aspect ratio for the icon frame

### Typography Elements (Optional)
- If incorporating a letter, use "P" for PastorPro
- Keep any letterforms bold and simple
- Consider placing typography within a shape rather than standalone

## Technical Specifications
- Create a square canvas (1024×1024px recommended for app stores)
- Include appropriate padding (approximately 100px on all sides)
- Ensure the design works well at multiple sizes (16×16px to 1024×1024px)
- Export in PNG format with transparency
- Also prepare a variant with rounded corners for iOS

## Design Examples for Inspiration
- Think of the simplicity of calendar app icons but with pastoral ministry elements
- Consider the minimal approach of productivity apps like Notion or Asana
- Reference modern church apps that balance professional and spiritual aesthetics

## Avoid
- Overly detailed illustrations that won't scale down well
- Religious imagery that might be too denomination-specific
- Dark or somber color schemes that don't convey the helpful nature of the app
- Cluttered designs with multiple competing elements

## Final Deliverables
1. Main icon in 1024×1024px PNG format with transparency
2. iOS variant with rounded corners
3. A small preview showing how the icon looks at different sizes (512px, 192px, 96px, 48px)

This minimal approach will ensure the icon is recognizable and professional while representing the purpose of the PastorPro app - helping pastors efficiently manage their ministry activities.
