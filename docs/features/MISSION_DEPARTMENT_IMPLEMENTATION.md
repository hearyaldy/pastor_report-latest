# Mission-Based Department Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Department Service Updates
- **Updated the Seed Method**: Modified the `seedDepartments` method in `department_service.dart` to create department entries for each mission.
- **Added Mission Field**: All departments now have a `mission` field that specifies which mission they belong to.
- **Created Reseeding Utility**: Added a `reseedAllDepartments` method that clears all existing departments and recreates them with proper mission data.

### 2. New Admin Utilities Screen
- **Created Dedicated Screen**: Added `admin_utilities_screen.dart` with functionality to manage administrative tasks.
- **Department Reseeding Feature**: Implemented a UI to trigger department reseeding with confirmation dialog.
- **Error Handling**: Added proper loading indicators and error handling for database operations.

### 3. Routes and Navigation
- **Added New Route**: Updated `constants.dart` to include the `routeAdminUtilities` constant.
- **Updated Main App**: Modified `main.dart` to register the new admin utilities route.
- **Updated Admin Dashboard**: Added a FloatingActionButton to navigate to the admin utilities screen.

## How It Works

1. **All Missions Have Departments**:
   - Each mission (Sabah Mission, North Sabah Mission, Sarawak Mission, Peninsular Mission) now has its own set of departments.
   - All departments have sample form URLs for data collection.

2. **Department Filtering**:
   - The app continues to strictly filter departments by mission.
   - Users will only see departments for their assigned mission.

3. **Admin Tools**:
   - Administrators can use the new utilities page to reseed all departments if needed.
   - This ensures all missions have the proper department data.

## Next Steps

To make the changes take effect, an admin user should:

1. Log into the app as an admin user
2. Navigate to the Admin tab
3. Tap the tools (build) FloatingActionButton to access Admin Utilities
4. Run the "Reseed Departments with Mission Data" function to populate all missions with departments

This will ensure that all users, regardless of their mission, will see mission-specific departments when they log in.
