# Implementation Summary: Mission-Specific Department Filtering

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mission Warning Banner
Removed the warning banner that was showing when departments from other missions were displayed. Since departments should strictly be filtered by mission, this banner is no longer needed.

**File:** `/lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`
- Removed the `showMissionWarning` logic that checked if any departments were from other missions
- Removed the UI components that displayed the warning banner
- Updated the comments to indicate that mission filtering is enforced at the service level

### 2. Updated Empty State Messages
Improved the empty state messages when no departments are found to be clearer about mission requirements.

**File:** `/lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`
- For users with a mission: "No departments found for [mission name] mission"
- For users without a mission: "No mission assigned to your account"
- Added appropriate guidance messages for each scenario

### 3. Fixed Navigation Issue
Fixed an issue with the profile screen where logout was trying to navigate to a non-existent route.

**File:** `/lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`
- Changed the navigation target after logout from `/dashboard` to `/` to ensure proper routing

## Validation
These changes ensure that:
1. Departments are strictly filtered by mission at the service level
2. Users see clear, mission-specific messages when no departments are found
3. The profile navigation works correctly after logout

## Further Recommendations
- Ensure that all new users are assigned to a mission during registration
- Consider adding a UI for mission administrators to manage departments specific to their mission
- Add data validation in Firestore rules to ensure departments are created with a valid mission
