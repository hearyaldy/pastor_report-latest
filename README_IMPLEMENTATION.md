## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Firebase Setup (REQUIRED)
You MUST set up Firebase before the app will work. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for your project
flutterfire configure
```

**See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.**

### 2. Create Admin User
After Firebase is set up:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication
2. Add a user with email/password
3. Note the UID
4. Go to Firestore Database
5. Create collection `users`
6. Add document with UID as document ID:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "admin@example.com",
     "displayName": "Admin Name",
     "isAdmin": true
   }
   ```

### 3. Replace Placeholder URLs
Update these in `lib/utils/constants.dart`:
- Ministerial form URL
- Education form URL
- Publishing form URL
- Personal Ministry form URL
- Adventist Community Services form URL

### 4. Android Release Signing
Before releasing to Google Play:

1. Generate keystore:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

2. Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=<your-password>
keyPassword=<your-password>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/path/to/upload-keystore.jks
```

3. Uncomment signing config in `android/app/build.gradle`

### 5. Test the App

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on device/emulator
flutter run

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle for Play Store
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Firebase Security Rules**: Update Firestore rules in Firebase Console (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md)

2. **Never Commit**:
   - `firebase_options.dart`
   - `google-services.json` (Android)
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
   - `android/key.properties`
   - `*.jks` keystore files

Add to `.gitignore`:
```
firebase_options.dart
**/google-services.json
**/GoogleService-Info.plist
**/key.properties
**/*.jks
```

3. **Production Checklist**:
   - [ ] Set proper Firestore security rules
   - [ ] Enable Firebase App Check
   - [ ] Set up proper email templates in Firebase
   - [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive config
   - [ ] Enable Firebase Crashlytics
   - [ ] Set up proper backup for Firestore

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not initialized" error
- Run `flutterfire configure`
- Ensure `firebase_options.dart` exists
- Check `Firebase.initializeApp()` is called in `main()`

### "User not found" when signing in
- Create user in Firebase Console > Authentication
- Add user document in Firestore `users` collection

### Build errors
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter run
```
