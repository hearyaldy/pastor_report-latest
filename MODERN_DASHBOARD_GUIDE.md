# Modern Dashboard Implementation Guide 🎨

## Overview

The app now features a modern, user-friendly dashboard with the following flow:

1. **Splash Screen** → Shows for 3 seconds with app branding
2. **Dashboard** → Main screen showing all departments (no login required)
3. **Lazy Authentication** → Login only prompted when user clicks a department
