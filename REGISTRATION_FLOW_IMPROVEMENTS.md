# Registration Flow Improvements

## Overview

This update simplifies the user registration process and enhances the onboarding flow in the Pastor Report app with a modern and user-friendly UI. The changes include:

1. **Simplified Registration**: Users now only need to provide basic information (Full Name, Email, Password, and Mission) during initial registration with a modern interface.
2. **Enhanced Onboarding**: After registration, users complete their profile by selecting or adding their Region, District, Church, and Role information in a visually appealing way.
3. **Admin Features**: Super Admins can access the enhanced onboarding screen from the settings to manage Regions, Districts, and Churches.
4. **Modern UI Design**: Both screens feature a consistent gradient background, card-based layouts, and improved typography.
